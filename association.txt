1. What are association rules?
Ans: Association rules are part of data mining used for finding patterns in data. An
association rule is an implication of the expression X -> Y, where X and Y are two
disjoint itemsets and X subsetequal I and Y subsetequal I, and X intersect Y = phi.

1. What is the arules package?
Ans: The arules package provides the required infrastructure that creates and manipulates
the input dataset for any type of mining algorithm. It also provides features to analyse
the resulting itemsets and association rules.

2. What is an “itemMatrix”?
Ans: The arules package provides a class “itemMatrix” that efficiently represents binary
incidence matrix containing the itemsets and items.

3. What is a hash tree?
Ans: A hash tree is a type of data structure that stores values in key-value pairs and a type of tree where every internal node contains the hash values.

1. What is an apriori() function?
Ans: The package “arules” provides a function apriori() that performs association rule
mining using Apriori algorithm. The function mines the frequent itemsets, association
rules, and association hyperedges.
